Sheldon Bangera is a worship leader, song-writer, music composer and producer from Mumbai, India. He is married to Anita Bangera and is father to Amanah Rose and Shanaya Grace.

Initially, an Engineer by profession, Sheldon turned full time musician at the age of 25. Ever since, Sheldon has penned over 200 worship songs, many of which are sung in churches across the world. For most part of the year on tour, Sheldon is a good connect with campus students through his inspirational life story and contextualised music. He is also India’s first and only artist to be signed up by global giant Integrity Music. One of the most influential worship leaders of this generation, Sheldon has travelled to over 10 countries and hundreds of cities around the world. From 2016 to 2018, Sheldon and the band travelled to more than a hundred cities in India by road, reaching out to half a million people as part of the ‘India On Wheels Tour’. In 2019, Sheldon and the band travelled to 22 cities and 12 states of the USA as part of the ‘America On Wheels Tour’ winning the hearts of thousands of Americans.

Sheldon along with Dr. Rony Parakal co-founded the JAAGO Movement and the JAAGO Conferences. Sheldon, later started JAAGO Music and has used his global influence to encourage and help establish several upcoming artists and songwriters. His initiative ‘India On Wheels’ is aimed at using music as a tool to reach and uplift unreached and underprivileged people groups and sects in India.

Sheldon’s album ‘Nachoonga’ was featured in the best sellers list for three years in a row and created a ripple effect across the globe. With millions of youtube views, his songs are sung as anthems in various schools across the country. His subsequent release ‘Raaja Hai Mahaan’, was a groundbreaking move turning eyeballs towards India for the usage of Indian instruments such as the sarod, flute, tablas, dholak, mridangam, ghattam, sitar and manjira. A song from that album ‘Forevermore’ was featured in Integrity Music’s Ultimate Worship Collection 2016, the first ever Indian worship song to see such a feat. His latest and first ever all-English album ‘Your Name’ is the first ever English album to have his own songs translated from Hindi to English and also happens to be the first ever album of an Indian Independent Worship Artist to play on Christian radio in America. Sheldon is also the first ever artist to represent India and share the stage with artists such as Planetshakers, Bethel Music, Lecrae and others as part of the Jesus Global Youth Day in Manila, Philipines in 2019 that saw 50,000 in physical attendance and 1,50,000 via broadcast.

Besides his musical artistry and ministry, Sheldon and his wife Anita run a production company called Breadbutterjam Productions, a music institute called Crescendo Institute of Music and several projects among the slums of Mumbai reaching, teaching and uplifting the poorest of poor.
