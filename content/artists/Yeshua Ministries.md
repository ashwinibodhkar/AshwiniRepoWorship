Formed in the year 2002 by lead vocalist, song-writer & music composer Cameron Mendes, ‘Yeshua Ministries’ is a team of musicians and singers from the bustling city of Mumbai, India, who are committed to spreading the message of peace, hope and love of Jesus through their catchy and up-beat music like, ‘Yeshu Tera Naam Sabse Uncha Hai’, ‘Gao Hallelujah’, ‘Hum Gaye Hosanna’ and ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll’, ‘Tu hi Rab hai’, in India and the world over.

Apart from making new Hindi worship music, we travel to different parts of the country to do worship concerts/workshops, thus encouraging and influencing young musicians/upcoming worship leaders and teams all over. During our events we engage the crowd in emphatic praise and intense worship and also include exhortations, altar calls followed by ministry time.

Our music, that has revolutionised the entire face of Hindi worship all over the world, spans different genres with a lot of variety from high praise to intense worship in different languages through brilliant transitions. Being pioneers in the area of progressive song-writing, we have been responsible to influence many other Hindi worship leaders of today and we continue to write fresh new & original music and strive for excellence in all that we do.
