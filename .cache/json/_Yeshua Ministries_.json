During our events we engage the crowd in emphatic praise and intense worship and also include exhortations, altar calls followed by ministry time.\r\n\r\nOur music, that has revolutionised the entire face of Hindi worship all over the world, spans different genres with a lot of variety from high praise to intense worship in different languages through brilliant transitions. Being pioneers in the area of progressive song-writing, we have been responsible to influence many other Hindi worship leaders of today and we continue to write fresh new & original music and strive for excellence in all that we do."}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"LetsWorship"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Yeshua Ministries/"}}
